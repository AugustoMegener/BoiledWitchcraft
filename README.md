A mod that brings the magic system from the acclaimed show The Owl House! Use glyphs and (in the future) much more directly from the boiling islands!

## Actual features

### Glyphs on blocks
Right-clicking on blocks with the new Pencil item in hand will make a glyph on the ground, clicking or stepping it will execute the magic. (See the "Applied on block" on the table above.)

### Glyphs on papers
You can also create glyphs on papers that you can apply on blocks and use on air to throw a projectile. (See the "Used on paper" on the table above".)
